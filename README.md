## Description
This is a simple app showing the 'has_many through' relationship between resources. in this app we have resources for 'students', 'projects', and 'assignments'. the active relationship is that 'students' have many 'projects' through 'assignments' and vice versa. most work can easily be done through scaffolding and a few adjustments to resource 'show' and 'index' views allow for a text base rendering of created data. also, adding a few extra links will prevent the scaffolded environment from linking users into a corner with no way back. feel free to use as a reference!
